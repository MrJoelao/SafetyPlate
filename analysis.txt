## 2. Key Components

The main components and their responsibilities are:

*   **Screen Components (app folder):**
    *   `Planner`, `diary`, `index`: These are the main screens of the application, each responsible for a specific section of the app (meal planning, food diary, etc.).
    *   `import-food`, `manage-food`: Handle food import and management functionalities.
    * `meal-entry`: Modal Component for inserting new food.
*   **UI Components (components/ui folder):**
    *   `FoodForm`, `FoodListItem`, `InlineFoodEditor`: Responsible for the UI related to food management.
    * `AddEditFoodModal`, `FoodImportView`, `FoodManagerView`: UI for specific modals
    *   `Calendar`, `TimeSlots`: Display data in specific layouts.
    *   `ActionButton`, `FloatingActionButton`, `IconButton`: Custom buttons for user interaction.
    *   `ImagePicker`, `NutritionInput`, `QuantityInput`, `SearchBar`: Reusable input components.
    *   `ScreenHeader`: A custom header component for screens.
*   **Common Components (components/common folder):**
    *   `ThemedText`, `ThemedView`: Basic components providing theming support.
*   **Layout Components (components/ui/layout folder):**
    *   `ParallaxScrollView`, `ScreenHeader`: Define screen structure and behavior.

## 3. Data Flow and State Management

*   **Data Flow:** Data primarily flows from the `utils/foodStorage.ts` module, which handles data persistence. Components like `FoodForm` and `FoodManagerView` likely interact with this module to load, save, update, and delete food data.
*   **State Management:**
    *   The project doesn't appear to use Redux or a similar state management library.
    *   Custom hooks (`useFoodForm`, `useColorScheme`) are used to manage local component state and potentially share some state across components.
    *   The `FoodImportView` receives a callback function `onSuccess` that is triggered after a successful import, indicating a pattern of passing data up through component hierarchies.
    * The state of the application is managed by each single component.
* **Hooks**:
    * `useFoodForm`: This hook is used for managing the state of the food form.
    * `useColorScheme`: This hook is used for managing the color scheme.
    * `useSlideAnimation`: This hook is used for managing the slide animations.
    * `useThemeColor`: This hook is used for managing the theme colors.

## 4. Data Persistence

*   **AsyncStorage:** The application uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` to store food data locally on the user's device.
*   **`foodStorage.ts`:** This utility module handles all data persistence operations related to food.
    *   `saveFoods`: Saves an array of `Food` objects to AsyncStorage.
    *   `addFood`: Adds a new `Food` object to storage.
    *   `updateFood`: Updates an existing `Food` object.
    *   `deleteFood`: Deletes a `Food` object.
    *   `loadFoods`: Loads all `Food` objects from storage.
    * `parseFoodFromText`: Parse the food from the imported text file.
*   **Data Format:** Food data is stored as an array of `Food` objects in JSON format.

## 5. Navigation

*   **Expo Router:** The project utilizes Expo Router for navigation, enabling file-based routing.
*   **File-Based Routing:** The `app` folder structure directly defines the navigation hierarchy. For example, the `(tabs)` and `(settings)` folders define tab and settings routes.
*   **`useRouter`:** The `useRouter` hook from Expo Router is used within components to navigate programmatically.
*   **Layouts:** The `_layout.tsx` files are used to define layouts for specific sections of the app.

## 6. Styling

*   **`StyleSheet`:** The project primarily uses React Native's `StyleSheet` for styling.
*   **`Colors.ts`:** This file defines a set of colors that are used throughout the application.
*   **Theming:** The `useColorScheme` and `useThemeColor` hooks indicate support for theming, potentially allowing users to switch between light and dark modes.
* **External library**:  `react-native-paper` is used for some styling.

## 7. Food Management

*   **Parsing:** The `parseFoodFromText` function in `foodStorage.ts` is responsible for parsing food data from a text file. It splits the content into lines, parses each line for a name and score, and creates a `Food` object. It handles error conditions like empty files or invalid data format.
*   **Storing:** Food data is stored using `AsyncStorage` as JSON. Each food item has an `id`, `name`, `score`, `defaultUnit`, and optionally, `imageUri` and `nutritionPer100g`.
*   **Adding:** The `addFood` function adds a new food item to the existing list in storage.
*   **Updating:** The `updateFood` function finds an existing food item by its ID and replaces it with the updated data.
*   **Deleting:** The `deleteFood` function removes a food item by its ID.
* **Food Types**: The food types are located in `types/food.ts`

## 8. Potential Extension Points

*   **Improved State Management:** Implementing a global state management system like Redux or Zustand would allow for better organization and sharing of application state, especially as the app grows in complexity.
*   **Advanced Food Data:** Adding support for more comprehensive food data (e.g., allergens, detailed nutritional information) would enhance the app's utility.
*   **User Profiles:** Implementing user profiles would enable personalized settings, dietary restrictions, and other user-specific data.
*   **Backend Integration:** Integrating with a backend API would enable data synchronization across multiple devices and social features.
*   **Enhanced Statistics:** Adding more detailed statistics and data visualization would provide users with better insights into their eating habits.
*   **Meal Recommendations:** Implementing a meal recommendation engine based on user preferences and dietary restrictions would be a valuable addition.
*   **Notification System**: Implement a notification system for alarms and errors.
* **Import/Export**: Allows the user to import or export the data on the device.
* **Localization**:  Add localization to allow users to set the correct language.
