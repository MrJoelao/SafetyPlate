    *   `ParallaxScrollView`, `ScreenHeader`: Define screen structure and behavior.

## 3. Data Flow and State Management

*   **Data Flow:** The application follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:
    * Data is stored in the global context state
    * Components access data through context hooks
    * Actions are dispatched to update the state
    * Context providers handle state updates and persistence
    * The persistence layer (FoodStorage) handles data storage and retrieval

*   **State Management:**
    *   The project uses React's Context API for global state management, organized into three main contexts:
        * `AppContext`: Manages application settings like theme and language
        * `FoodContext`: Manages food data and operations
        * `UserPreferencesContext`: Manages user preferences like allergies and dietary restrictions
    *   Each context implements a reducer pattern similar to Redux, with actions and state updates
    *   The `RootProvider` in `store/context/index.tsx` combines all contexts to provide global state to the entire application
    *   Components access state through custom hooks like `useAppContext`, `useFoodContext`, and `useUserPreferencesContext`

*   **Context Structure:**
    *   Each context follows a similar pattern:
        * State interface defining the shape of the state
        * Action types defining possible state updates
        * Reducer function handling state transitions
        * Provider component managing state and exposing actions
        * Custom hook for accessing the context

*   **Custom Hooks:**
    *   `useFoodForm`: Manages food form state and interacts with the food context for saving data
    *   `useThemeColor`: Accesses theme colors based on the current app theme from AppContext
    *   `useSlideAnimation`: Manages animation state for UI elements

## 4. Data Persistence

*   **Storage Architecture:** The application uses a layered approach to data persistence:
    * **BaseStorage:** A generic base class that provides common storage functionality:
        * Versioning support for data schema evolution
        * Data validation through validator functions
        * Error handling and standardized result objects
        * Migration capabilities for handling schema changes
    * **FoodStorage:** Extends BaseStorage with food-specific functionality:
        * Food data validation
        * CRUD operations for food items
        * Text parsing for food import
        * Singleton pattern for consistent access

*   **AsyncStorage:** The application uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as the underlying storage mechanism.
    * Data is stored with versioning information to support future migrations
    * Keys are namespaced to avoid conflicts (e.g., '@safetyplate_foods')
    * JSON serialization is used for storing complex objects

*   **Legacy Compatibility:** The original `utils/foodStorage.ts` module is maintained for backward compatibility:
    * All functions now delegate to the new FoodStorage class
    * Helper functions in `types/storage.ts` convert between old and new result formats
    * Deprecation notices guide developers to use the new API directly

*   **Data Operations:** The FoodStorage class provides the following operations:
    * `loadFoods`: Retrieves all food items with versioning support
    * `saveFoods`: Saves all food items with validation
    * `addFood`: Adds a new food item to the collection
    * `updateFood`: Updates an existing food item by ID
    * `deleteFood`: Removes a food item by ID
    * `parseFoodFromText`: Parses food data from text format
    * `importFoodsFromText`: Combines parsing and saving operations

*   **Data Format:** Food data is stored as an array of `Food` objects in JSON format, with additional version metadata.

## 5. Navigation

*   **Expo Router:** The project utilizes Expo Router for navigation, enabling file-based routing.
    * File-based routing simplifies navigation structure
    * The `app` folder structure directly defines the navigation hierarchy
    * Group folders like `(tabs)` and `(settings)` organize related screens
    * `_layout.tsx` files define layouts for specific sections of the app

*   **Navigation Guards:** The application implements navigation guards to protect routes:
    * `NavigationGuard` component in `components/ui/navigation/NavigationGuard.tsx`
    * Guards check conditions (like onboarding completion) before allowing access to protected routes
    * Redirects to fallback routes when conditions aren't met
    * Provides loading states during condition checking

*   **Onboarding Flow:** A specific guard for onboarding ensures users complete the setup process:
    * `OnboardingGuard` wraps the main app tabs
    * Checks AsyncStorage for onboarding completion status
    * Redirects new users to the welcome/onboarding flow

*   **Transition Animations:** The app uses custom transition animations between screens:
    * Different animation types for different navigation actions:
      * `slide_from_right` for settings and detail screens
      * `slide_from_bottom` for modal screens
      * `fade_from_bottom` for tab navigation
    * Animation durations and easing are customized for a smooth experience

*   **Programmatic Navigation:** Components use Expo Router hooks for navigation:
    * `useRouter` for navigating between screens
    * `useSegments` for accessing the current route path
    * `Link` component for declarative navigation

## 6. API Service Layer

*   **Service Architecture:** The application implements a comprehensive API service layer:
    * **Interfaces:** Clear interfaces define the contract for API services
      * `ApiService`: Base interface for common HTTP operations
      * `FoodApiService`: Food-specific API operations
      * `UserPreferencesApiService`: User preferences API operations
    * **Base Implementation:** `BaseApiService` provides common functionality:
      * HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
      * Error handling
      * Request configuration
      * Response parsing
    * **Caching Layer:** `CachedApiService` adds caching and offline support:
      * Transparent caching of GET requests
      * Offline mode with fallback to cached data
      * Cache expiration and invalidation
      * Network state detection

*   **Mock Services:** The application includes mock implementations for development:
    * `MockFoodApiService`: Simulates a food API with in-memory data
    * Realistic response delays and error conditions
    * Consistent with real API behavior

*   **Service Factory:** A factory pattern is used to create service instances:
    * `ServiceFactory` provides the appropriate implementation based on environment
    * Supports switching between mock and real implementations
    * Handles service caching for performance

*   **API Types:** Comprehensive type definitions ensure type safety:
    * Request and response types
    * Error handling types
    * Common API patterns

## 7. Styling

*   **`StyleSheet`:** The project primarily uses React Native's `StyleSheet` for styling.
*   **`Colors.ts`:** This file defines a set of colors that are used throughout the application.
*   **Theming:** The application supports dynamic theming through the AppContext:
    * Theme can be set to 'light', 'dark', or 'system' (follows device setting)
    * The `useThemeColor` hook provides access to theme-appropriate colors
    * Theme settings are persisted in AsyncStorage
*   **External library**:  `react-native-paper` is used for some UI components.

## 8. Food Management

*   **Food Data Model:** The application uses a well-defined food data model:
    * Core food properties: id, name, score, defaultUnit
    * Optional properties: imageUri, nutritionPer100g
    * Nutrition information includes calories, proteins, carbs, and fats
    * Type definitions in `types/food.ts` ensure type safety

*   **Food Operations:** The application provides comprehensive food management:
    * **Adding:** New food items can be added through forms or import
    * **Updating:** Existing food items can be modified
    * **Deleting:** Food items can be removed from the collection
    * **Importing:** Bulk import from text files with specific format
    * **Validation:** Data validation ensures integrity

*   **Food Forms:** The `useFoodForm` hook provides form management:
    * Form state management with validation
    * Integration with the FoodContext for persistence
    * Support for both creating and editing food items
    * Handling of form submission and errors

*   **Food Storage:** The FoodStorage class handles persistence:
    * Versioned storage with migration support
    * Data validation before storage
    * Efficient CRUD operations
    * Text parsing for imports
